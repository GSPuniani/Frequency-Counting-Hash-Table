# Frequency-Counting-Hash-Table
<i>Make School CS 1.2: Assignment 3</i>

This project was created with Python 3.7.4.

This project uses a hash table to implement a word-frequency counting program. My implementation uses chaining (with linked lists) in the event of collisions. My hash function calculates the index for a word based on the number of consonants in that word. This project works with any text file that contains letter-only words (no apostrophes). Words are counted on a case-insensitive basis, and punctuation is ignored.
